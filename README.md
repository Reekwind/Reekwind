Hi, I’m @Reekwind (Creakthistle)
I’m interested in ... properties to interact with direct attributation (Safe system organization with intact structural integrity. that is, actual parallels in actual order) Safe is not the same as locked. Safe and open, with own/self regulation, if possible) Difficult to express.

I’m currently learning ... I am not sure, Must learn all environments it seems, in order to find one that is actually true.

I’m looking to collaborate on ... Do not know, modding Skyrim SE, systematically minded... wanting to find a language that is natural to me.

How to reach me ... ON here I suppose or UniformProcess@outlook.com, UniformProcess most places

Early beginner, mostly manipulating code based on intent rather than methodical practice step by step. The more code I see interacting with itself, the better.


Please go ahead and give critique in any form, I need to learn. I am as things are, merely fiddling about. No need to supply me with directions or holding my hand just correct me, short and concise is fine, I won´t Nuke anyone with questions I just need additional information in order to systematically suprapolate, intraspectate, extrapolate, interpolate, correct rearrange adapt synthesize reorganise but never superpolate without proper cause and reason relative my internal structures of understanding of all of these intertwined systems.... I have realised it is not possible to learn only one programming language..


And I know nothing.
